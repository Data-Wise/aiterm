## 🎯 Current Focus: Custom Commands & MCP Refactoring
**Task:** Inventory and refactor Claude CLI custom commands and MCP servers
- Analyze ~/.claude/commands/ (194 files)
- Analyze ~/.claude/settings.json MCP servers (3 configured)
- Identify duplication and opportunities for consolidation
- Propose refactoring into organized plugins
- Better maintenance and discoverability

## 📋 Planned Refactoring Outcomes
1. Organize commands into logical plugin groups
2. Convert standalone commands into plugin skills
3. Identify commands that should be MCP server tools
4. Create plugin architecture for better maintenance
5. Reduce duplication across 194 command files
