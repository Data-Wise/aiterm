# v0.6.0 Plan - Interactive Tutorial System

**Status:** Planning
**Target:** Mid-January 2026
**Theme:** Interactive onboarding, learning, user education
**Effort:** 36-48 hours over 3-4 weeks

---

## Overview

Add `ait learn` command with 3 progressive tutorials (30 total steps) following the proven Nexus CLI pattern - reducing new user time-to-productivity from 2 hours to 30 minutes.

**Spec:** `docs/specs/SPEC-interactive-tutorial-system.md` (merged PR #7)

## Command Interface

```bash
ait learn                        # List all tutorials
ait learn getting-started        # 7 steps, ~10 min
ait learn intermediate           # 11 steps, ~20 min
ait learn advanced               # 12 steps, ~30 min
ait learn <level> --step N       # Resume from step N
```

## Tutorial Content

### Level 1: Getting Started (7 steps)
- What is aiterm? → doctor → config → detect → switch → help → next steps

### Level 2: Intermediate (11 steps)
- Claude Code (primary) → workflows → sessions → terminals

### Level 3: Advanced (12 steps)
- Release (v0.5.0) → workflows → integrations (Craft/MCP/IDE) → debugging

## Core Files

```
src/aiterm/utils/tutorial.py      # NEW: 600-700 lines (tutorial engine)
src/aiterm/cli/main.py            # MODIFIED: +50 lines (learn command)
tests/test_tutorial.py            # NEW: 40+ tests
docs/tutorials/interactive-learning.md  # NEW: MkDocs page
TUTORIAL_GUIDE.md                 # NEW: Standalone reference
```

## Architecture (Nexus Pattern)

```python
# Core components
class TutorialLevel(Enum):
    GETTING_STARTED = "getting-started"
    INTERMEDIATE = "intermediate"
    ADVANCED = "advanced"

@dataclass
class TutorialStep:
    title: str
    description: str
    command: str
    hint: str
    validate: Optional[Callable]

class Tutorial:
    def show_intro(self) -> None: ...
    def show_step(self, step: int) -> None: ...
    def run(self) -> None: ...
    def show_completion(self) -> None: ...
```

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Tutorial completion rate | 60%+ |
| Time to productivity | <30 min (vs 2 hours) |
| Test coverage | 90%+ |
| Support question reduction | 40% |
